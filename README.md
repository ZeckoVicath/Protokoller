# Protokoller
An open source minute taker written in PHP, XML, HTML and JS released under AGPLv3 or later

# people.txt

Protokoller was designed to read the regular meeting members from the `config.php` file. But since version 0.5 it is also possible to store these members in the `people.txt` file, one person per line. To activate this feature, the `config.php` must not contain a `$PEOPLE` array. It is possible to edit the `people.txt` file directly from the web by using the `update_people.php` entry point.
